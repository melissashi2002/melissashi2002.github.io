The chatbot research project involved developing Zenny, an LLM-powered chatbot for depression self-management. The project, conducted from February to September 2024, utilized OpenAI's API to enhance the chatbotâ€™s natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. The goal was to provide personalized mental health support while maintaining user retention. The project also involved conducting participant interviews to explore user interactions with the chatbot and analyzing the feedback using qualitative coding to refine and improve its responses
