Will be updated more details soon!✨

In the first phase of the study, we have revealed that caregivers seek a combination of external support and self-care practices to address these concerns, highlighting the importance of accessible resources and coping strategies in mitigating mental health issues. Additionally, we explored caregivers’ attitudes toward technology and the existing challenges they encounter, highlighting opportunities for improvement. The proposed enhancements emphasize the need for accessible, personalized, and user-friendly technological support that addresses caregivers’ unique and evolving needs. These insights contribute to designing more empathetic, caregiver-centered technological solutions and underscore the role of policy and community support for caregivers’ mental health. By better understanding caregivers’ multifaceted needs, our study provides a foundation for creating tailored interventions that support caregivers holistically, benefiting both them and the care recipient. 


In the second and third phase of the study, we will use the scenarios-based on the eight major identified concerns from the literature and the improvements proposed by the participant in the first phase, design a chatbot for caregivers’ mental health. Based on the literature and findings from the first phase, this would help understand caregivers’ needs, build a more robust and safe tool, and conduct field deployment and speculative design workshops.
