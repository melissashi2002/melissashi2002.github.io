Recognizing the critical role that caregivers play, this research seeks to identify the unique challenges they face, the current
practices they employ to manage their mental well-being, and the technologies they use for mental health support. Through a
series of in-depth interviews, we will gather insights into caregivers' mental well-being needs and current practices to cope with
mental well-being concerns. Additionally, the study will examine caregivers' perceptions and reactions to an envisioned AI-driven
chatbot designed to provide mental health support. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of caregiver mental
health needs and inform the development of effective support tools and interventions.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:
