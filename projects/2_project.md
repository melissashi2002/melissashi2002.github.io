Recognizing the critical role that caregivers play, this research seeks to identify the unique challenges they face, the current
practices they employ to manage their mental well-being, and the technologies they use for mental health support. Through a
series of in-depth interviews, we will gather insights into caregivers' mental well-being needs and current practices to cope with mental well-being concerns. Additionally, the study will examine caregivers' perceptions and reactions to an envisioned AI-driven chatbot designed to provide mental health support. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of caregiver mental health needs and inform the development of effective support tools and interventions.
